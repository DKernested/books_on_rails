<strong>About K6</strong>
<p class="mb-5">
Archetype K6 is my gaming handle. My real name is Dillon Kernested.
Former tradesman, currently a bartender, recently a father, and a wannabe web developer and programmer.
I hope you enjoy this web app as I learn to meet Kyle Geske's requirements for this project!

I am a fifth semester BIT student at Red River and this project is
my creation for the class Fullstack Web Development. Ruby on Rails is pretty rad.
Much more orgaized than PHP, and much more readable than JavaScript. Also Gem's are fun.
